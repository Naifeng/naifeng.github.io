Our paper on *Faster Game Solving via Hyperparameter Schedules* was accepted at [AAAI 2026](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-26/). This work started as my [Computational Game Theory](http://cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/cs15-888F23/) course project and has since been taught in the course in [the following years](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/cs15-888F25/CFRspeedups-Slides.pdf).
