I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by Professor [Franz Franchetti](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~franzf/). 

I received a bachelor's degree in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) with [honors](https://viterbiundergrad.usc.edu/ehp/) and a bachelor's degree in [Mathematics](https://dornsife.usc.edu/mathematics/) with [honors](https://catalogue.usc.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=12&ent_oid=2528&hl=honors) from the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), advised by Professor [Viktor K. Prasanna](https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/). My undergraduate research is featured [here](https://sites.usc.edu/dslab/projects/system-performance-prediction/). 

My research interests lie in the areas of code generation, compilers, and programming languages. Currently, I am developing [SPIRAL](http://www.spiral.net/) for 

⬇️ High-performance **code generation** targeting [CPUs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3725843.3756120), [GPUs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3696443.3708948), and [ASICs](assets/pdf/ISPASS_RPU_2023.pdf);

⬆️ **Semantics lifting** for performance portability and [safeguarding AI-generated code](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09201).
