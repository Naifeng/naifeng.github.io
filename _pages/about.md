I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by Professor [Franz Franchetti](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~franzf/). 


I received a bachelor's degree in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.usc.edu/) with [honors](https://viterbiundergrad.usc.edu/ehp/) and a bachelor's degree in [Mathematics](https://dornsife.usc.edu/mathematics/) with [honors](https://catalogue.usc.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=12&ent_oid=2528&hl=honors) from the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), advised by Professor [Viktor K. Prasanna](https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/). 


My research interests lie in the areas of high-performance code generation, programming languages, compilers, and algorithms.

My undergraduate research is featured [here](https://sites.usc.edu/dslab/projects/system-performance-prediction/). 

Currently, I am contributing to [SPIRAL](http://www.spiral.net/) and [NTTX](http://www.spiral.net/software/nttx.html).
